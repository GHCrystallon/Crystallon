## Terms

**Voxel**  
_noun_

(In computer-based modeling or graphic simulation) an array of elements of volume that constitute a notional three-dimensional space, which a representation of a three-dimensional object is divided. The word voxel originated by analogy with the word "pixel", with _vo_ representing "volume"and _el_ representing "element".

**Unit Cell**  
_noun_

(In crystallography) the smallest group of atoms of a substance that has the overall symmetry of a crystal of that substance, and from which the entire lattice can be built up by repetition in three dimensions.

**Lattice**  
_noun_

(In material science) a regular repeated three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a metal or other crystalline solid.
