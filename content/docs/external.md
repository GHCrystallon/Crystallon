Crystallon was developed to be "open source" by creating each component as open clusters using only native Grasshopper components, though, a few components do require the use of external plugins. Crystallon is also intended to be used in conjuction with other great plugins and software for things like simulation and meshing. To take full advantage of the capabilities of Crystallon, please consider installing the latest versions available of the following plugins and external software:

**Kangaroo Physics (by Daniel Piker)**  
http://www.food4rhino.com/app/kangaroo-physics  
> Kangaroo is a Live Physics engine for interactive simulation, form-finding, optimization and constraint solving.

**Dendro (by ECR LABS)**  
https://www.food4rhino.com/app/dendro  
> Dendro is a volumetric modeling plug-in for Grasshopper built on top of the OpenVDB library. It provides multiple ways to wrap points, curves, and meshes as a volumetric data type, allowing you to then perform various operations on those volumes. Dendro includes components for boolean, smoothing, offsets, and morphing operations.

**Tetrino (by Tom Svilans)**  
https://www.food4rhino.com/app/tetrino  
> TetGen is a program to generate tetrahedral meshes of any 3D polyhedral domains. TetGen generates exact constrained Delaunay tetrahedralizations, boundary conforming Delaunay meshes, and Voronoi partitions. (http://wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1)

**Weaverbird (by Giulio Piacentino)**  
http://www.giuliopiacentino.com/weaverbird/  
> Weaverbird is a topological modeler that contains many of the known subdivision and transformation operators, readily usable by designers. Instead of doing the work repeatedly, or sometimes using complicated scripts, this plug-in reconstructs the shape, subdivides any mesh, even made by polylines, and helps preparing for fabrication.

**Millipede (by Panagiotis Michalatos)**  
http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/millipede?
> Millipede is a structural analysis and optimization component for grasshopper. It allows for very fast linear elastic analysis of frame and shell elements in 3d, 2d plate elements for in plane forces, and 3d volumetric elements. All systems can be optimized using built in topology optimization methods and have their results extracted and visualized in a variety of ways.

**Mecway**  
https://mecway.com/
> Mecway is a comprehensive user friendly finite element analysis package for Windows with a focus on mechanical and thermal simulation such as stress analysis, vibration and heat flow. It is inexpensive and has an intuitive graphical interface for easy mesh creation and display of solutions.
