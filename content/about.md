Crystallon is an open source project for creating lattice structures using Rhino and Grasshopper3D. It was originally developed at FATHOM (www.studiofathom.com) by Aaron Porterfield (www.fequalsf.com) as an alternative to commercially available software for lattice design. The obvious advantage is the ability to generate lattice structures within Rhino’s design environment without exporting to 3rd party software, but the extended advantages include the modularity and ability to combine other powerful tools available for Grasshopper3D. The decision to release it as open source was not only to share it with the community, but to further the development through it’s users. We realize not all users will have the same applications and needs, so we hope to receive feedback and improvements from users with unique case studies. Each tool is left as a cluster which can be opened and modified at will, in the spirit of open source. We hope the community will continue to develop and contribute through the use of the Grasshopper forums (https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/plug-ins/crystallon/) and Github (https://github.com/fequalsf/Crystallon).

V1.0 -- This is the first initial release and we will begin bug fixes immediately as they are reported. Future plans are to include utilities for import and export between more robust simulation software packages which will be included in the next release. Enjoy :)  

V2.0 -- This is the second release. Updates have been made to many of the "voxelize" tools to allow for parameter based divisions using the graph mapper or other parameters as well as voxelizing curves. There are additional tools for working with meshes (triangles or quads). There is a new category called "2D" for flattening a ruled surface or a doubly curved mesh surface and applying "lattice hinge" or auxetic cells to the flat pattern. Lastly the "utilities" category includes tools for import and export of "LTCX" files from nTopology, as well as export of INP geometry files for FEA packages. Enjoy :)
