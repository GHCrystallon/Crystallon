# Crystallon
Crystallon is an open source project for creating lattice structures using Rhino and Grasshopper3D. It was
developed at FATHOM (www.studiofathom.com) by Aaron Porterfield (www.fequalsf.com) as an alternative to
commercially available software for lattice design. The obvious advantage is the ability to generate lattice
structures within Rhino’s design environment without exporting to 3rd party software, but the extended
advantages include the modularity and ability to combine other powerful tools available for Grasshopper3D. The
decision to release it as open source was not only to share it with the community, but to further the development
through it’s users. We realize not all users will have the same applications and needs, so we hope to receive
feedback and improvements from users with unique case studies. Each tool is left as a cluster which can be
opened and modified at will, in the spirit of open source. We hope the community will continue to develop and
contribute through the use of the Grasshopper forums (https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/crystallon) and Github.
